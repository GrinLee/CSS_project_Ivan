			<h2>Kohr cast</h2>
			<p> his net beyond planning goals, toward the not yet, the nondum, which the poet Paul Celan places to the "north of the future''. Kohr never attempted to seduce people into utopia, which is always a misplaced concreteness. He fostered a vision that could be realized because it fell within limits, it remained within reach. Kohr stood for renunciation -- to a ranging gaze that sought chimeras beyond the shared horizon.</p>
			<p><img src="images/ruche2.gif" width="90" alt="educats" class="imgCl"></p>
			<p>He was aware of the crippling effect of our upbringing; he knew that most people of his time had grown up on formula. Bottle-milk was the fashion; breasts would only make their comeback in the seventies. What Jacques Ellul calls the technological system made the commodity paradigm all-pervasive. Telling stories about his native village Oberndorf, where a schoolteacher -- Franz Xavier Gruber -- had composed "Silent Night'', he attempted to teach about what had become almost impossible: look to common sense in the midst of development euphoria.
			His character qualified him to be a spokesman for this lost "faculty'', common sense. He was a funny bird -- meek, fay, droll and incisive. Everett Reimer, also living in Puerto Rico at that time, introduced him to me as a coqui, a green tree frog, so tiny that few have ever seen one sitting in the hollow of a banana leaf. But the melodious croak of this tiny amphibian dominates Puerto Rican nights, making them different from the darkness elsewhere in the tropics. Unsurprisingly, the islanders have chosen the creature as their totem.</p><p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ivan-Illich"> Britannica online</a></p></div>

			<h2>During the later 60s</h2>
			<p>  I had a chance in a year and a half to give a dozen different addresses to people who were concerned with education and schooling at which I had looked as a historian. I asked myself, since when are people born needy? In need for instance of education. Since when do we have to learn the language we speak by being taught by somebody. I stood in front of a group and asked, who of you remembers from whom your child has learned walking? Among a hundred people certainly thirty would raise their hands and I would say, I guarantee you are all graduates of education schools.</p>
			<p> I wanted to find out where the idea came from that all over the world people have to be assembled in specific groups of not less than fifteen, otherwise it's not a class, not more than forty, otherwise they are underprivileged, for yearly, not less than 800 hours, otherwise they don't get enough, not more than a 1,100 hours, otherwise it's considered a prison, for four year periods by somebody else who has undergone this for a longer time. How did it come about that such a crazy process like schooling would become necessary? Then I realized that it was something like engineering people, that our society doesn't only produce artifact things but artifact people. And that it doesn't do that by the content of the curriculum, by what we are taught, but by getting them through this ritual which makes them believe that learning happens as a result of being taught. That learning can be divided into separate tasks. That learning can be measured and pieces can be added one to the other. That learning provides value for the objects which then sell in the market.</p></div>

			<h2>His vision </h2>
			<p><img src="images/bookEdu2.jpg" width="90" alt="educats" class="imgCr"></p><p>of a decent common life was predicated on modesty, not on plenty. He began with the propensity of Salzburg folk to trust and enjoy the local ways distinctive of each valley. He saw the truth in their suspicion of universal values. He perceived how a good life could be corrupted. Kohr remains a prophet today because even those social theorists for whom small is beautiful have not yet discovered that the truth of beauty and goodness is not a matter of size, nor even of dimensions or intensity, but of proportion. I see Kohr as the one social thinker who picks up the biological morphology of D'Arcy Thompson and J. B. S. Haldane as the starting point of a social morphology. These scientists studied the proportion between form and size in living creatures. Mice appear only within rather narrow parameters of size. One intuitively grasps mousy-ness - that familiar form of a small, compact body with tail that scurries across the floor on four swift and delicate legs. Such beings come in sizes from an inch to a foot. Haldane demonstrated that the form, mousy proportion, could not exist outside this lower and upper limit. Since the weight increases with the cube of its size, legs able to move a larger rodent would have to thicken beyond mousy proportions.

			<p>Kohr discusses society in analogy to the way plants and animals are shaped by their size and sized by their shape. He is uninterested in the timeless and weightless critters elaborated by social scientists. As a friend remarks, these abstractions appear to come out of "social thought about mice on the moon''. </p>
